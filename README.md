The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Redux to manage global state.`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `Shopping Cart` - TIL on 07/06/2021 !

Able to build the `Shopping Cart` using react & redux.\
To calculate and display the total amount to pay, we can use 'reduce' in JavaScript.

The code is as follow.

```javascript
let amount = cart.reduce(
(prev, curr) => prev.price _ prev.qty + curr.price _ curr.qty
);
```

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
